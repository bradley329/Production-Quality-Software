The author really did a great job and the code is very clear to read.

Things I found nice in the code:

1. The code is very clean and well organized.

2. For "StopwatchImplementation":
  2.1. Used "final" keyword for id and lock.
  2.2. Used "temporaryLap" to decide whether the lap time should continue.

3. For "StopwatchFactory":
  3.1. Used "ConcurrentHashMap". 
  3.2. There is only one factory, so used "static" for all data structures.
  3.3. Check for nulls.


Things I think could be improved:

1. In each method which involves data to be locked, the author basically locks the whole thing in the method,
   some instructions may be unnecessary. 

2. May want to override hashCode() and equals() methods for Stopwatch.
