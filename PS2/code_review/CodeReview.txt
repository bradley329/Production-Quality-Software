Things I found nice in the code:

1. The author thinks of the details, for example, he/she build extra classes for address, name, phone number and email. 

2. For Contact, ContactName, ContactAddress, and ContactPhoneEmail:
  2.1. Used builder pattern and each of them has override the "toString()" method. 
  2.2. Only have getters and no setters which protect the info.
  
3. Built a Validator to check the validity of phone and email using regex.


Things I think could be improved:

1. The author allows null for strings, I think it would be safer if we check whether they are null first, for example, we usually do not allow null for name. 

2. In my Eclipse, it seems the indentation is tab, which is not desirable.

3. Did not override hashCode() and equals() methods for Contact.

4. When read from and write to a file, using {try with resources} is preferable.

5. AddressBook did not explicitly override toString(), buildStringContact() is actually toString().
